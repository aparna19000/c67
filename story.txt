once upon a time ther was a lion that was perying for food in the jungle. 
The lion caught a mouse.

The lion was going to eat the mouse but the mouse begged for mercy, so the lion did not kill it
and let it go.

The next day the lion was caught by the humans in a net trap. The mouse was walking by, 
so the lion asked the mouse to help him. The mouse remembered that how the lion had taken 
pity on him and let him go that other day.
